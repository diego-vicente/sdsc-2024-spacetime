# _Where & When_: A Space-Time Analysis of Vehicle Collisions in London

> Join us to explore a comprehensive use case, analyzing data with CARTO's Analytic Toolbox function through both the Workflows interface and the SQL console. We'll delve into space-time functions, working with geolocated time series data, and extracting insights through methods like space-time Getis-Ord, hotspot analysis, and time series clustering.

This repository contains all the material used in the workshop, organized in different formats for ease of use. Here you can find:
- A [complete transcript](./transcript.md) with supporting material like code, maps or images;
- A folder containing [all of the SQL queries](./sql) used in the workshop;
- Links to the other relevant materials like [the slides]() used.
